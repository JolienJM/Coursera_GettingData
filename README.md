This repo contains an R script, which reads in data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set (UCI Machine Learning repository, can be downloaded here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

It also contains CodeBook.md, which explains which files from the data sets were used and what analysis steps were performed on the data.

The result of the script is text file 'tidyDataset_UCI_HAR.txt'. This is a tidy version of the dataset, which has the mean and standard deviation (std) for each variable per subject and per activity.

Read CodeBook.md for more information.
